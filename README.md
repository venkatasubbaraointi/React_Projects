This Folder contains multiple React Projects(POCs) with features like React Hooks(useEffect, useRef, useState, useReducer ), REST API using Firebase database(how to retrieve and send data to firebase database through API), Few projects also include NEXT.js for routing. Other major features like React Routers, Redux are also included in this project bundle. And I have also implemented test cases for a few of the react projects using JEST Testing Tool.
